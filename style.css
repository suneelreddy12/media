/* When you use flex: 1;, it is shorthand for flex-grow: 1; flex-shrink: 1; flex-basis: 0;. This means:

- The item will grow to fill the available space (relative to other items with flex-grow set).
- The item will shrink if there is not enough space (relative to other items with flex-shrink set).
- The item has a base size of 0, meaning it will not take up any extra space by default and will rely entirely on the
  flex-grow property to determine its size. */
